# Cognifyz-Internship-Projects

This repository showcases the tasks completed during my **Machinee learning at Cognifyz Technologies**. Each task focuses on a specific real-world problem using data analysis and machine learning.

## 🔍 Overview

- **Task 1:** Predict aggregate restaurant ratings using regression models
- **Task 2:** Classify restaurants based on their cuisines
- **Task 3:** Geographical analysis of restaurants using Python visualization tools
- 🔹 Task 1: Predict Restaurant Ratings (Regression)
Objective: Build a regression model to predict restaurant ratings based on features like cuisine, location, and price.

Key Steps:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Label encoding for categorical features

Training linear regression and decision tree models

Evaluation using R² and Mean Squared Error

Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn

🔹 Task 2: Classify Restaurants by Cuisine (Classification)
Objective: Classify restaurants into cuisine categories using machine learning.

Key Steps:

Data preprocessing and encoding

Model training with Logistic Regression and Random Forest

Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall

Tools: Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Pandas

🔹 Task 3: Geographical Analysis of Restaurants
Objective: Visualize and analyze restaurant distribution by city and locality.

Key Steps:

Mapping restaurant coordinates using Folium

Grouping by city/locality to explore concentration

Calculating average ratings, price ranges, and cuisine variety

Tools: Folium, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas
